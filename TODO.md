# List of things to maybe add
- Add proper folder structure and export functions (rather than dumping all files in root)
- User soft deletion
- Clean up user struct and refactor
- Add JWT to all GET endpoints
1. add global admin(?) permission to view all endpoints
2. users can only hit their own endpoints
3. safety on transfer
- ??
